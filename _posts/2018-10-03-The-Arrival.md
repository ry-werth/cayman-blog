title: "The Arrival"

Welp here goes my first post! I have no idea how long I will be making these, and I don't have much of a plan so bear (bare?) with me if I ramble. I landed in the Buenos Aires International Airport (EXE) at 9:00 pm on Saturday, September 29th. I had a car scheduled to pick me up from the airport, and when trying to meet my driver I quickly realized that not knowing Spanish will be a _bit_ of a hurdle to overcome in this new city. I was texting him just fine by using a translator app, but when he couldn't find me he decided to call me. I picked up, heard some Spanish being hurled at me, panicked, and hung up. I then proceeded to ask a taxi driver what terminal I was at, and how I could find my driver. This taxi driver wasn't very thrilled to help a gringo like me with directions, much less directions to _another_ taxi. But alas, I found my driver and we were on our way.

I am staying at an Air Bnb in San Telmo, the oldest neighborhood in Buenos Aires. There are five other students living with me, two from Italy, two from Spain, and one from Colombia. The property owner and a property manager also live with us. They have all been extremely welcoming and friendly to the new kid who doesn't know how to speak Spanish.

In the first few days here I have been getting a good idea of my surroundings. On Sunday I got to walk around the famous San Telmo Sunday market. This gave me a great introduction to my neighborhood and the local culture. I have gotten my bus pass and learned where and how to put money on it. I have also gotten a local sim card for my phone and learned that there's this thing called a country code that actually comes before the area code. Most importantly, I have gotten set up at the office I will be working at for the next month. It is a WeWork Community workspace here in Buenos Aires. I got the "hot-desk" plan, meaning that I find a new spot every day. In my three days working here, I have taken a liking to working on the 24th floor as it provides great views I didn't have when I was working from my kitchen table. Another cool perk is the free beer from 12-8pm. But I'm there to work so I try and limit my libations to one an hour. 

Overall my introduction to this city, thankfully, has been uneventful for the most part. On Monday, I had a bus full of commuters give me a communal death stare as I delayed the bus trying to figure out how I was supposed to pay. There was a man on the platform whom I now know is there to charge me and give me a ticket to expedtie the boarding process during rush hour(rather than paying on the bus as usual). I didn't know that at the time though, and when the man kept repeating something to me in Spanish, I found myself unable to do anything but smile awkwardly and stare back at him. Meanwhile, I can feel everyone on the bus staring harder at me and I swear I can hear them thinking out loud "How dumb is this damn white guy".  Finally, the man grabs my card and charges some undisclosed amount, and gave me a ticket. For all I cared he charged me to the end of the line and back. I was just thankful he put an end to that small moment of misery. I then climbed into the bus and squeezed in with all of the irritated locals, very fun. 

The interesting thing with situations like that, and with every time I've given someone my phone number when they ask for my name (c'mon nombre sounds a whole hell of a lot like number), is that I've strangely enjoyed it. For the first time in a long time, I am a real outsider. I'm in a foreign place with only myself to lean on, a spot I've never really been in. While I'm still walking in the wrong direction more times than not, I figure that's kind of why I came down here. Ask me in two weeks if I still enjoy being the lost foreigner and maybe I won't be so positive. But so far, I have had a great time stumbling my way around this new city.
