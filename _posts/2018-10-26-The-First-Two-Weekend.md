title: "The Arrival"
---

I have been pretty poor posting updates so far, but seeing as only my parents will be reading this I'm not too worried. I'm actually writing this on October 26th, roughly three and a half weeks since I first arrived in Buenos Aires. But this post will focus on my first three weekends here in this new city so buckle up and get ready to read. 

My first full Saturday here actually started off with me getting a gym membership at a spot about two blocks from my house. The facility is no JCC, but it has everything I need to try and keep the empanada weight at bay. (gym picture) When I first hopped on the treadmill I thought I had somehow found myself in incredible shape as I was running a 6-minute mile with ease. It wasn't until I inspected the screen further that I realized I had actually run a 6-minute kilometer. A much less impressive feat. 

Saturday afternoon I went to the horse (caballo in Spanish) races with two of my housemates. The track is located in a neighborhood called Palermo. From what I understand so far, this is the more modern, upper-class part of Buenos  Aires. There are fancy apartment complexes, big parks, and for night-time entertainment, Palermo is where the nightclubs are. But unsurprisingly, it was the horse track that first attracted me to this part of town. I've been spoiled with the prestige and beauty of Golden Gate Fields in Berkeley California, so my race track standard is set pretty high. The track in Palermo fulfilled these high expectations. The facility was beautiful. (horse race pics) There were granite steps for the spectators to watch the races from, a small paddock to view the horses, and a food area with a large bbq and a few food trucks. It proved difficult to translate all of my horse-racing slang from English to Spanish. After a few races, I had "win", "place", and "show" down which ended up being all I needed. I left the races with the same amount of money I arrived with, so  I deemed it a successful outing. 

The next day I woke up early and took a tour of Teatro Colon, Buenos Aires' Opera House, upon my Dad's recommendation. I wouldn't necessarily consider my self an expert on the subject, but in my opinion, it was really quite a remarkable Opera house. There were beautiful stain glassed windows, sculptures, and paintings. I learned on my tour that it is widely recognized as one of the top Opera Houses in the world, both from an architectural and an acoustics standpoint. 

After the Opera house, I continued my touristy day by heading down to the neighborhood of Boca. Boca is a very colorful neighborhood, both metaphorically and literally. (Boca Picture)
There are colorful buildings and tango dancers lining the streets. This neighborhood is also home to the famous Boca Juniors soccer (futbol) stadium. Boca Juniors is one of multiple professional futbol teams in Buenos Aires, but is arguably the most popular. I visited the stadium to see the inside, but I ended up going to game a few weekends later so I will fill you in more when I get there. All in all, it was a great first-weekend exploring different parts of the city. 

The next weekend I planned a trip to Uruguay. For those of you who are as geographically challenged as I am, Uruguay extends off the south of Brazil and is a two-hour ferry ride from Buenos Aires. The Thursday before I left for Uruguay I went to a casino on an old-timey boat (casino picture) with two of my housemates. I was hoping to get some fun spending money for the weekend but ended up broke within 15 minutes of my arrival. I blame it on the language barrier. So the next morning I woke up bright and early and made my way to the Ferry. I arrived in the Capital city of Montevideo at about 10 am on a foggy, overcast Friday morning. I was five miles from my hostel and had about 5 hours until check-in so I decided to walk. It turned out to be a great way to see the city as I unknowingly strolled through the "old-town" which I was later told is a "must see". 
I checked into my hostel and met a nice group of travelers right away. A girl from Denmark, a girl from Luxenberg, a girl from Settle, and two guys studying abroad in Buenos Aires.  We formed a nice little group and went on to explore the city together for the next 48 hours. On Saturday we all rented bikes for the day and took them all over the city. Montevideo is known for its beautiful coastline, and Saturday was a wonderful day to bike along it. The weather was perfect and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. We stopped at a lighthouse and I got to climb to the top and get a gret view of the city. There was a large food festival taking place in the city center where we got some lunch and cocktails. 
After lunch, we decided to head to an old military fort on top of a large hill at the outskirts of the city. We were told there were gorgeous views, but the surrounding neighborhoods were not necessarily the safest. We headed out anyway. After an hour of riding our Santa Barbara style cruisers, we headed up the final incline towards the fort. A car pulled up to us and reminded us to be careful. Im not sure if it was the bright orange rent-a-bikes, the blond Denmark hair, or my Pale Irish skin, but I guess it was clear our group was not from around there. Although we were a bit nervous to be receiving safety reminders, we peddled on and soon reached our destination. We were rewarded with gorgeous views of Montevideo, the Ocean, and the surrounding areas. (pictures). 
On our trip back home my bike chains broke 6 times. After the . However, they did their best at hiding this frustration and we made it back to the hostel safe and sound around 9 pm. We ordered Pizza and bought a bunch of wine and had a very fun night meeting travelers from all over the world. 
The next morning I woke up early with a pounding headache and managed to find my way to the Bus station. I attempted to cure the affects of the prior night's red wine with a breakfast of red gatorade but it did not help much. The 4-hour bus ride to the old city of Colonia felt like 8 hours. 
I spent 3 hours exploring the small town of Colonia before catching a return ferry to Buenos Aires. Colonia's history dates back to the 17th century and is a lovely, albeit dinky, town to spend an afternoon in. I climbed another lighthouse here, and have decided that lighthouses are in fact a great tourist location. They are always located in very cool and beautiful locations, and if you are allowed to climb them you get an amazing 360-degree view of your surroundings. I may just write a book about lighthouses around the world. Anyways I arrived in Buenos Aires Sunday night exhausted from the weekend, sank into the couch and watched the afternoon American Football games. 
Jeeze this post is getting long. Im going to end it now. Next post will include a costume party, a Soccer game and an all you can eat Argentinian birthday dinner! stay tuned.
