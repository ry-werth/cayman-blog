I was born in raised in San Francisco, California. I went to university at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and after four and a half years I graduated with a Physics degree. While in college I started interning at the company I currently work for [Draftboard](https://draftboard.com/). Draftboard is a daily fantasy sports website, go check it out. Seriously check it out, it's cool. Anyways, I work remotely and all I really need to work is good internet connection. This job gives me the ability to travel and work from wherever, and I figure I should take advantage of that perk while I have it. So I decided to travel around South America. I will be working in CoWorking spaces, cafes, libraries, and Air Bnbs all along the way.
