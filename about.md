I am born in raised in San Francisco, California. I went to university Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and after four and a half years I graduated with a Physics degree. While in college I started interning at the company I currently work for [Draftboard](https://draftboard.com/). Draftboard is a daily fantasy sports website, go check it out. Seriously check it out, it's cool. Anyways, I work remotely and all I really need to work is a good internet connection. This job gives me the ability to travel and work from wherever, and I figure I should take advantage of that perk while I have it. I will be working in CoWorking spaces, cafes, libraries, and Air Bnbs all along the way. 

I constantly come across the "Why Aouth America?" question. To be honest, it was pretty arbitrary. South America allows me to stay in a similar time-zone to my work and family back home and for the most part it won't break the bank. I guess those are really the only reasons. I'm looking for a change of pace, and something new. I guess we will see if I find it.
