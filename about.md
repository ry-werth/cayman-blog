I was born in raised in San Francisco, California. I went to university at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and after four and a half years, I graduated with a degree in physics. While in college I started interning at this company called [Draftboard](https://draftboard.com/). Draftboard is a daily fantasy sports website, you should go check it out. Seriously go check it out, it's cool. Anyways, after I graduated my boss decided it would be a good idea to hire me. Yeah I'm not sure why either, you'd have to ask him. 

So here I am. I do a little bit of everything with the site, from writing articles to working on small web devolopment projects. Luckily for me, I am able to work remotely, and all I need to work is good internet connection. This gives me the ability to travel and work from wherever, so I figure I should take advantage of that perk while I have it. I decided to travel around South America, starting with Argentina. I will be working in Co-Working spaces, cafes, and libraries while living out of hostels and Air Bnb's all along the way. Oh, and I don't speak spanish, so I will be attempting to learn some as it may prove useful.
