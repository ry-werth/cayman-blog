On September 28th 2018 I set out for South America to live, work, and travel. After graduating from University in December of 2017 I moved back to live with my parents in lovely San Francisco. While life back at home was an absolute dream (hi mom and dad!), I figured it was time to spread my wings and fly! So I booked a flight to Buenos Aires Agentina, kissed my ma and pa goodbye and left.

My plan is to spend roughly a month in Buenos Aires, then head as far south as I can before I run out of land. I will then make my way back up north along the western Side of Argentina, through Chile, through Peru, through Colombia and really just keep going until I don't feel like going anymore. Who knows how well I will keep to this outlined itinerary, but having a rough plan made my Dad happy. 

The goal of this site is to document everything along the way for those who care. Enjoy!
